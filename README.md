# Project 3 - Work Log

This is an application written in python to provide a user the ability to create work logs with the attributes of a title, date, time spent, and notes.

These works logs can be queried by multiple parameters - job title, time spent, exact date, date range, and keyword search.

The entries can be edited and deleted as needed.

The output file these entries are stored in is a csv file.
